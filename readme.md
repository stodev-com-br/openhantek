## Features

* Digital phosphor effect to notice even short spikes
* Voltage and Spectrum view for all device supported chanels
* Math channel with these modes: Ch1+Ch2, Ch1-Ch2
* Freely configurable colors
* Export to CSV, JPG, PNG or print the graphs
* Supports hardware and software triggered devices
* A zoom view with a freely selectable range
* All settings can be saved to a configuration file and loaded again
* Multiple instances with a different device each can be started
* The dock views on the main window can be customized by dragging them around and stacking them.
  This allows a minimum window size of 640*480 for old workstation computers.

## Install prebuilt binary
Navigate to the [Releases](https://github.com/OpenHantek/openhantek/releases) page.
* [Download Windows build](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/openhantek/openhantek/branch/master/artifacts)

## Building OpenHantek from source
You need the following software, to build OpenHantek from source:
* [CMake 3.5+](https://cmake.org/download/)
* [Qt 5.4+](https://www1.qt.io/download-open-source/)
* [FFTW 3+ (prebuild files will be downloaded on windows)](http://www.fftw.org/)
* libusb 1.x (prebuild files will be used on windows)
* A compiler that supports C++11

We have build instructions available for [Linux](docs/build.md#linux), [Apple MacOSX](docs/build.md#apple) and [Microsoft Windows](docs/build.md#windows).

## Run OpenHantek
You need an OpenGL 3.2+ or OpenGL ES 2.0+ capable graphics hardware for OpenHantek.
OpenGL is prefered, if available. Overwrite this behaviour by starting OpenHantek
from the command line like this: `OpenHantek --useGLES`.

USB access for the device is required:
* As seen on the [Microsoft Windows build instructions](docs/build.md#windows) page, you need a
special driver for Windows systems.
* On Linux, you need to copy the file `firmware/60-hantek.rules` to `/lib/udev/rules.d/` and replug your device.

## Specifications, Features and limitations
Please refer to the [Specifications, Features, Limitations](docs/limitations.md) page.

## Contribute
We welcome any reported Github Issue if you have a problem with this software. Send us a pull request for enhancements and fixes. Some random notes:
   - Read [how to properly contribute to open source projects on GitHub][10].
   - Create a separate branch other than *master* for your changes. It is not possible to directly commit to master on this repository.
   - Write [good commit messages][11].
   - Use the same [coding style and spacing][13]
     (install clang-format. Use make target: `make format` or execute directly from the openhantek directory: `clang-format -style=file src/*`).
   - Open a [pull request][12] with a clear title and description.
   - Read [Add a new device](docs/adddevice.md) if you want to know how to add a device.
   - We recommend QtCreator as IDE on all platforms. It comes with CMake support, a decent compiler, and Qt out of the box.
